# SOTR: Segmenting Objects with Transformers

## Introduction

We present a novel, flexible, and effective transformer-based model for high-quality instance segmentation. The performance of SOTR achieves 40.2% of AP with the ResNet-101-FPN backbone on the MS COCO benchmark. Also, SOTR demonstrates significantly better performance on medium 59.0% and large objects 73.0%.
